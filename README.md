# lenovo-thinkpad-x260-hackintosh-monterey
Functional efi for lenovo x260 laptop, working with monterey 12.6.7

Efi created only for this model, I do not recommend the use in other models.

If you are thinking of making a hackintosh with this model you can take the efi and try it, but I am not responsible for any type of use that is going to be given to it.
